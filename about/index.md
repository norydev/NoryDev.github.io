<p class="lead" markdown="1">I’m Fabien Loup. I'm a Freelance Software Engineer.</p>

I can help your project, company, startup or just provide consulting for your ideas. I have worked with founders building their MVPs, tiny startups, growing startups, scale-ups and larger companies. I can write code, and I can also take a architectural/technical lead position, whatever the needs are.

My strongest technical skills are in Ruby (on and off Rails) and relational databases - in particular PostgreSQL. I’m also proficient in frontend JavaScript/TypeScript and pretty up-to-date with the latest frameworks. Other than that, I have enough Ops skills to be dangerous, and can pretty much tag along on any project or technology. I have been part of many international teams, including in a lead position.

My style is definitely oriented towards Quality™ and long-term thinking, in all aspects of work (and life). That being said, I know where to make trade-offs and I will take pride in documenting every corner that has to be cut for reasons.

I can work in English or French. I'm only considering fully remote contracts at the moment. If you are interested in working with me, contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabien-loup-b60431147" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
