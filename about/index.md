<p class="lead" markdown="1">I’m Fabien Loup. I'm a Senior Software Engineer.</p>

I currently work for [Almanac](https://almanac.io), a platform for async collaboration.

Prior to that, I worked for various companies, either as a full time employee or as a consultant, both on-site and remotely. A long time ago, I graduated and then worked as an Electronics Engineer in my home country, Switzerland.

I like to [Hitchhike](https://www.somewherexpress.com) around Europe with my friends. If you are also a Hitchhiker or traveler and want to meet up, contact me on [Trustroots](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/redfox).

I'm norydev on the Internets. As people ask me what “norydev” means: it's an anagram of my [hometown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yverdon-les-Bains).
